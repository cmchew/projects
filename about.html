      <p>I'm a journalist and self-taught software engineer learning by building. I started out building websites for small business owners from scratch using HTML and Dreamweaver. During the the pandemic I upskilled in cybersecurity and now want to specialize in building secure code to protect user privacy and prevent website attacks. 
        I specialize in both front-end and back-end web development, and love working with analytics, clean code, and performance optimization.</p>
